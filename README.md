## Instructions for creating tables with Makefile
Download the zip file. Follow instructions for assignment 1 to get SQL running. Once sql is running go into the unzipped file and run make setup_postgres

All the data should be in the order that they are added to the table in that file, seperated by commas (no space seperating, but space is fine if we want it in the word). You can run queries to check if the data is uploading correctly by running psql -d $USER and then filling out a query
