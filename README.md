## Instructions for creating tables without Makefile
Download both the tables for drop and create tables. Once the tables are created, they will stay so if you need to re run the create tables, run the drop tables first. Next, start the SQL server. Follow first step of the optional part of assignment 1 to start the server. Before running the command psql -d $USER, you want to create the tables so run psql -f CreateTables.sql which creates the tables.
