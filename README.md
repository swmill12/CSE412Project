We need to use some sort of server to run this locally. I used MAMP to run it.
Things to do:
Design UI
Create Database
Create Website Functionality
To be safe about preventing anybody's work from getting erased, create your own branch and then merge your branch in with the main branch and solve any merge conflicts
## Instructions for MAMP
Download link: https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/
After downloading move PHP files into htdocs folder
To run go to http://localhost:8888/hello.php with hellp.php replaced with file name
